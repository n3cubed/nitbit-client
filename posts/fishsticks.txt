§P
  A 2D physics simulation app that runs in the browser. This app is supposed to be a learning tool. It helps to visualise physics problems dynamically and solve many problems, approximately, by building it in simulation.
§P
  "Many problems" mostly refers to problems that can be simulated with a small number of objects (i.e. problems that are abstracted) and problems that demonstrate first principles concepts. Basically problems found in textbooks.
§P
  v1 will be limited to 2 dimensions and will focus on interface and classical mechanics. It will use the Rapier Physics Engine. The physics are reasonably accurate. More accuracy comes at the cost of performance.

§P
  Todo list by priority, v1:
§OList
   Make the CLI easy to use and more complete.
  Write a command and keyboard shortcut guide.
  Make the Plotter to generate graphs.
  Make a GUI for some toggles.
  Move physics part to webassembly.
  Add polygon support (and other shapes)
  Make the Drawer to handle all shapes
  Add other mechanics (springs, pulleys, tension, friction...)
  Make the Solver to handle all calculation things
  Add more mechanics (angular kinematics...)
§P
  v2 will explore other ideas like 3D and more mechanics and visuals (waves, fluid, light).
